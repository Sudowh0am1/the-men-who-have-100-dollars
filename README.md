 this is the Question : there's 50 men and each one has 100 dollar. how much money will remain for each one
 if in every round they give exactly 1 dollar to a random person.
 suppose that we do it 200 times. POINT : the one who has zero money will be omitted.

-- somehow just a simple practice on datasience
